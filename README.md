## PyOS

*This is an "operating system" written in python!*

#### What's Working...
- Adduser
- Deluser
- Passwd
- Pasword Hasher
- Database Checker
- Something like a gui.

#### What's not working...
- Everything else

#### Running...
There is not a working shell so you have to run the script manualy from ***only*** pyos.py script.
Feel free to edit the code and test the various ***(6 )*** fuctions that it has to offer ***:)***...
To run the "os" run the this command:
```sh
python3 pyos.py
```
Also you can run the gui for testing purposes. To run the gui:
```sh
cd pyos_gui/
python3 gui.py
```

**Warning:** The gui side does not currently offer any functions rather that outputing text on the python console when a button is pressed.
