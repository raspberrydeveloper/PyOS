## PyOS

*This is an "operating system" written in python!*

#### What's Working...
- Adduser
- Deluser
- Passwd
- Pasword Hasher
- Database Checker
- Shell
- Neofetch
- Uname
- Ping (Without switches)
- Something like a gui.

#### What's not working...

- Everything else

#### Running...

With this update **finaly** PyOS has a working shell that you can run commands! To run the main system run **only** pyos.py script with this command:

```sh
python3 pyos.py
```

*Note:* I am also working on gui (graphical user interface) for pyos that currently does not do anything rather that printing in the terminal what button is pressed.
If you want to see it run these commands inside the pyos directory:

```sh
cd Gui
python3 gui.py
```
