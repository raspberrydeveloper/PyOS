## PyOS

*This is an "operating system" written in python!*

#### What's Working...
- Adduser
- Deluser
- Passwd
- Pasword Hasher
- Database Checker

#### What's not working...
- Everything else

#### Running...
There is not a working shell so you have to run the script manualy from ***only*** pyos.py script.
Feel free to edit the code and test the various ***(6 )*** fuctions that it has to offer ***:)***...
To run the "os" run the this command:
```sh
python3 os.py
```
